# Mars Time Tools

This project will solve problems for future Martians and the Earthlings that interact with them.

This tool is meant to be a precise 1 to 1 match with [Nasa's Mars24 Java program](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/mars24/help/algorithm.html),
using their specifications as requirements.  Test coverage confirms accuracy matching Nasa's programs.

The intention is to continue to add highly accurate functionality in the future.
